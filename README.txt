THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT:
    
    By doing this project, I aimed to find out if the MACD technical indicator is, by itself, useful to predict the future price action of a stock. There are many different ways to use the MACD technical indicator, but I wanted to choose one for the focus of this project. I chose to focus on the MACD's histogram values. When the histogram values are very high/low, it shows that the stock has a lot of upward/downward momentum. I wanted to test whether or not higher values of upward momentum would mean that the price would drop more in the near future (mean reversion), and conversely whether or not higher values of downward momentum would mean that the price would rise more in the near future. I also wanted to gain experience with MySQL, AWS, grabbing data from an API, and deploying a machine learning model on the data I collected.

HOW I ACCOMPLISHED THE ABOVE GOALS:
    
    In order to examine the efficacy of the MACD indicator (used in the way I described above), I obtained historical price action data for Apple's stock. As I stated above, I wanted to gain experience with grabbing data from an API. In order to do this, I grabbed a two-year historical dataset (2020-present) from the Polygon.io API (in JSON format) with the requests library. I ended up using this data to test my ML models. In order to train my models, I used a six-year historical dataset (2012-2018) that I downloaded in the form of a CSV file from Yahoo Finance. I got the training data from Yahoo Finance because the Polygon API would only allow me to access a two-year historical period with the free version of their service. I loaded the API and CSV data into pandas dataframes, and then I calculated the MACD histogram values for each day in the datasets. Once this was done, I uploaded the data to an AWS relational database. I then pulled the data from AWS back into new dataframes. I did both of these AWS steps in order to gain experience with databases in the cloud and writing MySQL queries in Python. 
    Next, I began creating ML models that would allow me to test my hypothesis, which is as follows: the higher the MACD histogram value is on a given day, the greater the maximum percentage price decrease will be over the next five days. Conversely, the lower the MACD histogram value is on a given day, the greater the maximum percentage price increase will be over the next five days. I split my two datasets (train and test) into four datasets (train and test for positive histogram values and train and test for negative histogram values). The label for the negative histogram values was the maximum percentage price increase in the following five days, and the label for the positive histogram values was the maximum percentage price decrease in the following five days. I trained two models, one for positive histogram values and one for negative histogram values. Both models take one feature as input (the MACD histogram value of a day) and produce one label as output (the maximum percentage price increase or decrease (depending on the model) over the next five days). 
    Once the models had been trained, I created two plots (one for the negative histogram value model and one for the positive). They both contain test data plotted along with the model's predictions for that test data. I was mainly concerned with the slopes of the lines that were produced by the models' predictions. The slope told me whether or not there was a correlation between MACD histogram values and future price action, and, if there was a correlation, whether or not it proved or disproved my hypothesis. I ended up getting these slope values by obtaining the weight of the connection from a model's one input neuron to the model's one output neuron (I did this for both the positive histogram value model as well as the negative in order to get both slopes).
     Conclusion: The slopes of the lines ended up being very small in magnitude, but they were both negative. Therefore, they both showed a correlation that supported my hypothesis, but they showed that this correlation was not very strong.
